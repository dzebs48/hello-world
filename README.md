# hello-world
This is the repository that github is making me create so that I can learn how to use github, which I am using as a part of my learning experience through the Odin Project.

The hope is to develop my skills for both career and personal fulfilment. I make websites on Wordpress every once in awhile, and find the work to be exciting because I'm really creating something. I once modded games, but found myself more interested in the coding mechanics and variables then anything graphical. So, I know I love creating things, and I know I enjoyed the coding aspects, which means this might be a good route for me. 

Do I see myself as a developer in the future? I'm not sure. I might go for a more expanded yet not-as-in-depth knowledge base to help me in tech positions within the nonprofit world (which is where my education and experience places me,) but who knows? I think I might like being a developer.
